              Welcome! This is my brand spankin' new website that I'm proud to say I made myself from scratch. Take a look around! I have a bit of a history with web stuff. I've had my own website for close to a decade and every one before this one was made with templates. To be able to say that I made it on my own is a pretty big deal for me. I'm sure there are probably more efficient ways that I could have done things, but those will be in future patches and updates (lol). Let's talk about it!

              So, the main goals that I was trying to accomplish with this website was to make something that was flexible as far as allowing me to upload different types of media, as well as something that was lightweight. This is the website that I had from 2014 to 2019. It worked pretty well for what I needed at the time but it was also very limiting for when I began to expand into other projects. Using templates were great for what I needed them for but there was a lot of bloat for features that I either didn't need or had no care for. Me not being that well versed in web design, it was a bit daunting to go through someone else's code to try and delete things that caused other things to explode.

              Here's the homepage of my previous site. You can't tell it in the video since it was loaded locally but this site was <b>slow</b>. It took a few seconds to do the initial load as well as any other navigation between pages. Also, at some point the text got really wonky and to this day I'm not sure what happened. Those darn templates man, I tell you. I loved the design of this site so much so that it was a lot of inspiration for my current one. I just thought, <em>"What if I turned it?"</em>
              <br>
              <br>
              By the way, you might also be wondering why there's 2 other websites instead of three considering this one is called 4.0. Welllll. I have a confession to make. My first website was also made from scratch but it was <b>garbage.</b> I'd still love to show it to you but I don't have those files anymore. I lost a lot of files some years ago.

            With the older sites (kind of) in mind, let's look at the new site starting with the home page. I had the idea early on to flip the page and do it horizontally based on some of the sites I've seen wihle researching inspiration. That in itself brought a few challenges of its own that we'll get into later. <br> <br>A new website for Octavian the Illustrator wouldn't be complete without...well...an illustration. You've probably already watched the process video at the top of the page so I won't stay on this for too long but  I spent about a week after getting most of the coding done to draw a brand new illustration just for the home page of my site. As you can tell I like octopus/octopuses/octopi. I had a lot of fun drawing that one.

            Making the gallery the way I wanted was the biggest <s>headache</s> challenge that I had with this project. I always come into projects with crazy goals and ambitions and then get stressed out when I'm in the middle of it. I always do what I set out to do though (if it makes sense). I originally wanted the gallery to scroll sideways as the user scrolled vertically but I quickly realized that that would be confusing for a lot of people. So I settled on buttons. I didn't want to add too many buttons so if the user gets to the end of the gallery, the button of that corresponding end will take them back to opposite end. <br> <br>

            It was also a priority that my gallery have filters since I do a lot of different things. Luckily, that was the least of my worries with this part of the page.

              The hardest part about the about page was coming up with enough things to say about myself. With this being the <s>second</s> first website I've made for myself from scratch, I really wanted to try and inject my weirdo personality in where I could.  There's not really much to say about this part of the page. Just some good ol' flexbox to keep it all together. <br> <br>The contact form is just a simple form that shoots me and email to remind me that someone thinks I'm cool.

              I'm sure most of the people looking at this page are probably on their phones (freakin' millenials) so I had to make sure my page worked well with different screen sizes. This task took a bit of work considering my main page is just one long page with a horizontally scrolling gallery. The placement of the menu button was based on how most people are probably holding their phones. Phone screens are pretty big these days and a lot of people's hands are pretty small. I thought putting the buttons on the bottom of the screen would allow people to keep stuffing their faces while scrolling the site. You're welcome.
